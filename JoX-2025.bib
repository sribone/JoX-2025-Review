Methylphenidate is an important stimulant prescribed to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. It has two chiral centers, but most current commercial formulations consist of the racemic mixture of the threo pair of methylphenidate isomers (d-, l-threo-methylphenidate). The d-isomer is the pharmacologically active component. Numerous studies reported that oral administration of the methylphenidate racemate undergoes first-pass, stereoselective clearance in humans with l-methylphenidate being eliminated faster than d-methylphenidate. Accordingly, the kinetics of hydrolysis of individual enantiomers by purified native and recombinant human liver carboxylesterases CES1A1 and CES2 and a colon isoenzyme CES3 were examined with a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry assay. The expression of CES1A1, CES2, and CES3 in Sf9 cells and the methods for purification of the three isoenzymes are reported. CES1A1 has a high catalytic efficiency for both d- and l-enantiomers of methylphenidate. No catalytic activity was detected with CES2 and CES3 for either enantiomer. The catalytic efficiency of CES1A1 for l-methylphenidate (kcat/Km = 7.7 mM–1 min–1) is greater than that of d-methylphenidate (kcat/Km = 1.3–2.1 mM–1 min–1). Hence, the catalytic efficiency of CES1A1 for methylphenidate enantiomers agrees with stereoselective clearance of methylphenidate reported in human subjects. Both enantiomers of methylphenidate can be fit into the three-dimensional model of CES1A1 to form productive complexes in the active site. We conclude that CES1A1 is the major enzyme responsible for the first-pass, stereoselective metabolism of methylphenidate.},

Oseltamivir is the main medicine recommended by the World Health Organization in anticipation of next influenza pandemic. This anti-influenza viral agent is an ester prodrug, and the antiviral activity is achieved by its hydrolytic metabolite: oseltamivir carboxylate. In this study, we report that the hydrolytic activation is catalyzed by carboxylesterase human carboxylesterase (HCE) 1. Liver microsomes rapidly hydrolyzed oseltamivir, but no hydrolysis was detected with intestinal microsomes or plasma. The overall rate of the hydrolysis varied among individual liver samples and was correlated well with the level of HCE1. Recombinant HCE1 but not HCE2 hydrolyzed this prodrug and produced similar kinetic parameters as the liver microsomes. Several HCE1 natural variants differed from the wild-type enzyme on the hydrolysis of oseltamivir. In the presence of antiplatelet agent clopidogrel, the hydrolysis of oseltamivir was inhibited by as much as 90% when the equal concentration was assayed. Given the fact that hydrolysis of oseltamivir is required for its therapeutic activity, concurrent use of both drugs would inhibit the activation of oseltamivir, thus making this antiviral agent therapeutically inactive. This is epidemiologically of significance because people who receive oseltamivir and clopidogrel simultaneously may maintain susceptibility to influenza infection or a source of spreading influenza virus if already infected.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT
Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is indicated for the treatment of breast and colorectal cancers. A three-step in vivo-targeted activation process requiring carboxylesterases, cytidine deaminase, and thymidine phosphorylase converts capecitabine to 5-fluorouracil. Carboxylesterases hydrolyze capecitabine’s carbamate side chain to form 5′-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5′-DFCR). This study examines the steady-state kinetics of recombinant human carboxylesterase isozymes carboxylesterase (CES) 1A1, CES2, and CES3 for hydrolysis of capecitabine with a liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy assay. Additionally, a spectrophotometric screening assay was utilized to identify drugs that may inhibit carboxylesterase activation of capecitabine. CES1A1 and CES2 hydrolyze capecitabine to a similar extent, with catalytic efficiencies of 14.7 and 12.9 min–1 mM–1, respectively. Little catalytic activity is detected for CES3 with capecitabine. Northern blot analysis indicates that relative expression in intestinal tissue is CES2 > CES1A1 > CES3. Hence, intestinal activation of capecitabine may contribute to its efficacy in colon cancer and toxic diarrhea associated with the agent. Loperamide is a strong inhibitor of CES2, with a Ki of 1.5 μM, but it only weakly inhibits CES1A1 (IC50 = 0.44 mM). Inhibition of CES2 in the gastrointestinal tract by loperamide may reduce local formation of 5′-DFCR. Both CES1A1 and CES2 are responsible for the activation of capecitabine, whereas CES3 plays little role in 5′-DFCR formation.},

Carboxylesterases metabolize ester, thioester, carbamate, and amide compounds to more soluble acid, alcohol, and amine products. They belong to a multigene family with about 50% sequence identity between classes. CES1A1 and CES2 are the most studied human isoenzymes from class 1 and 2, respectively. In this study, we report the cloning and expression of a new human isoenzyme, CES3, that belongs to class 3. The purified recombinant CES3 protein has carboxylesterase activity. Carboxylesterases metabolize the carbamate prodrug 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino] carbonyloxycamptothecin (CPT-11; irinotecan) to its active metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor. CYP3A4 oxidizes CPT-11 to two major oxidative metabolites, 7-ethyl-10-[4-N-(5-aminopentanoic acid)-1-piperidino] carbonyloxycamptothecin (APC) and 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-amino]-carbonyloxycamptothecin (NPC). In this study, we investigate whether these oxidative metabolites, NPC and APC, can be metabolized to SN-38 by purified human carboxylesterases, CES1A1, CES2, and CES3. We find that CPT-11, APC, and NPC can all be metabolized by carboxylesterases to SN-38. CES2 has the highest catalytic activity of 0.012 min-1 μM-1 among the three carboxylesterases studied for hydrolysis of CPT-11. NPC was an equally good substrate of CES2 in comparison to CPT-11, with a catalytic efficiency of 0.005 min-1 μM-1. APC was a very poor substrate for all three isoenzymes, exhibiting a catalytic activity of 0.015 × 10-3 min-1 μM-1 for CES2. Catalytic efficiency of CES3 for CPT-11 hydrolysis was 20- to 2000-fold less than that of CES1A1 and CES2. The relative activity of the three isoenzymes was CES2 > CES1A1 >> CES3, for all three substrates.},

  abstract = {Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) is the major hydrolase in human liver. The enzyme is involved in the metabolism of several important therapeutic agents, drugs of abuse, and endogenous compounds. However, no studies have described the role of human CES1 in the activation of two commonly prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: enalapril and ramipril. Here, we studied recombinant human CES1- and CES2-mediated hydrolytic activation of the prodrug esters enalapril and ramipril, compared with the activation of the known substrate trandolapril. Enalapril, ramipril, and trandolapril were readily hydrolyzed by CES1, but not by CES2. Ramipril and trandolapril exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics, while enalapril demonstrated substrate inhibition kinetics. Intrinsic clearances were 1.061, 0.360, and 0.02 ml/min/mg protein for ramipril, trandolapril, and enalapril, respectively. Additionally, we screened a panel of therapeutic drugs and drugs of abuse to assess their inhibition of the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate by recombinant CES1 and human liver microsomes. The screening assay confirmed several known inhibitors of CES1 and identified two previously unreported inhibitors: the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, isradipine, and the immunosuppressive agent, tacrolimus. CES1 plays a role in the metabolism of several drugs used in the treatment of common conditions, including hypertension, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus; thus, there is a potential for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. The findings in the present study may contribute to the prediction of such interactions in humans, thus opening up possibilities for safer drug treatments.},

CBZ-FP exhibited good cell permeability with a large stokes shift (116 nm) and can be applied to reveal the actual activities of CES1 in living cells associated with pesticides detoxification process. CBZ-FP can also serve as a fluorescence indicator of pesticide exposure in the way of hydrolyzing the carboxylic acid ester group in CBZ-FP. Therefore, CBZ-FP has high selectivity for CESs and can detect real-time activity of CES1 in biological samples. Molecular docking study was used to explore the binding of CESs and CBZ-FP. Finding that only one specific activity site of CESs can bind with probe. In view of the fact that, the biotransformation of drugs and poisons containing ester groups can carry out normally depending on CESs, Carboxylesterase probes are expected to contribute to the characterization of relevant disease.},

  abstract = {Human carboxylesterase 2 (CES2A), one of the most abundant hydrolases distributed in human small intestine and colon, play key roles in the hydrolysis of a wide range of prodrugs and other esters. Recent studies have demonstrated that CES2A inhibitors may ameliorate irinotecan-induced severe diarrhea, but the specific and efficacious inhibitors targeting intracellular CES2A are rarely reported. Herein, a large-scale screening campaign was conducted for discovery of potent and specific CES2A inhibitor(s). Following screening of more than one hundred of natural products, glabridin (a bioactive compound of Glycyrrhiza glabra L.) was found displaying potent inhibition on CES2A and high specificity over CES1A (>500-fold) and other serine hydrolases. Further investigation showed that glabridin was cell permeable and low cytotoxic, as well as capable of inhibiting intracellular CES2A in living cells, with the IC50 value of 0.52 μM. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that glabridin formed strong and stable interactions with both the catalytic cavity and Z site of CES2A via hydrophobic interactions. In summary, glabridin was a potent and specific inhibitor targeting intracellular CES2A, which could be used as an ideal lead compound to develop more efficacious CES2A inhibitors for modulating the pharmacokinetic behaviors of CES2A-substrate drugs and alleviating irinotecan-induced diarrhea.},

  abstract = {Increased hydrolysis of cocaine to nontoxic compounds is a promising way to prevent cocaine-induced toxicity. However, the short half-life of cocaine in the blood and the rapid conversion in the body to the hydrolysis-resistant metabolite benzoylecgonine, limits the therapeutic potential of serum proteins. Therefore, hydrolysis by tissue-specific hydrolases that do not generate benzoylecgonine deserves further investigation. Here, we report for the first time the mechanism of cocaine hydrolysis by the human carboxylesterase 2. We have combined conventional and accelerated Molecular Dynamics, which allowed us to identify the structural motions of the α1 and α10’ helices that act as a putative lid. Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics calculations on the full cycle showed that the rate-limiting step is the formation of benzoic acid (deacylation step) with a ΔG of 19.5 kcal mol−1 when calculated with B3LYP-D3/6–311++G(d,p). This ΔG value is in close conformity with the experimental value of 19.7 kcal mol−1.},

  abstract = {Human carboxylesterase 2 (hCE2), one of the major carboxylesterases in the human intestine and various tumour tissues, plays important roles in the oral bioavailability and treatment outcomes of ester- or amide-containing drugs or prodrugs, such as anticancer agents CPT-11 (irinotecan) and LY2334737 (gemcitabine). In this study, 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), the most abundant pentacyclic triterpenoid from natural source, was selected as a reference compound for the development of potent and specific inhibitors against hCE2. Simple semi-synthetic modulation on GA was performed to obtain a series of GA derivatives. Structure-activity relationship analysis brought novel insights into the structure modification of GA. Converting the 11-oxo-12-ene of GA to 12-diene moiety, and C-3 hydroxyl and C-30 carboxyl group to 3-O-β-carboxypropionyl and ethyl ester respectively, led to a significant enhancement of the inhibitory effect on hCE2 and the selectivity over hCE1. These exciting findings inspired us to design and synthesize the more potent compound 15 (IC50 0.02 μM) as a novel and highly selective inhibitor against hCE2, which was 3463-fold more potent than the parent compound GA and demonstrated excellent selectivity (>1000-fold over hCE1). The molecular docking study of compound 15 and the active site of hCE1 and hCE2 demonstrated that the potent and selective inhibition of compound 15 toward hCE2 could partially be attributed to its relatively stronger interactions with hCE2 than with hCE1.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT:
Fenofibrate, a marketed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR α) agonist, has been widely used for treating severe hypertriglyceridemia and mixed dyslipidemia. As a canonical prodrug, fenofibrate can be rapidly hydrolyzed to release the active metabolite (fenofibric acid) in vivo, but the crucial enzyme(s) responsible for fenofibrate hydrolysis and the related hydrolytic kinetics have not been well-investigated. This study aimed to assign the key organs and crucial enzymes involved in fenofibrate hydrolysis in humans, as well as reveal the impact of fenofibrate hydrolysis on its non-PPAR–mediated biologic activities. Our results demonstrated that fenofibrate could be rapidly hydrolyzed in the preparations from both human liver and lung to release fenofibric acid. Reaction phenotyping assays coupling with chemical inhibition assays showed that human carboxylesterase 1A (hCES1A) played a predominant role in fenofibrate hydrolysis in human liver and lung, while human carboxylesterase 2A (hCES2A) and human monoacylglycerol esterase (hMAGL) contributed to a very lesser extent. Kinetic analyses showed that fenofibrate could be rapidly hydrolyzed by hCES1A in human liver preparations, while the inherent clearance of hCES1A-catalyzed fenofibrate hydrolysis is much higher (>200-fold) than than that of hCES2A or hMAGL. Biologic assays demonstrated that both fenofibrate and fenofibric acid showed very closed Nrf2 agonist effects, but fenofibrate hydrolysis strongly weakens its inhibitory effects against both hCES2A and hNtoum. Collectively, our findings reveal that the liver is the major organ and hCES1A is the predominant enzyme-catalyzing fenofibrate hydrolysis in humans, while fenofibrate hydrolysis significantly reduces inhibitory effects of fenofibrate against serine hydrolases.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Fenofibrate can be completely converted to fenofibric acid in humans and subsequently exert its pharmacological effects, but the hydrolytic pathways of fenofibrate in humans have not been well-investigated. This study reported that the liver was the predominant organ and human carboxylesterase 1A was the crucial enzyme involved in fenofibrate hydrolysis in humans.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT
Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and clopidogrel are two major antithrombogenic agents that are widely used for the treatment and prevention of cerebro- and cardiovascular conditions such as stroke. Combined use produces enhanced therapeutic effect. Aspirin and clopidogrel both are esters, and hydrolysis leads to decreased or inactivated therapeutic activity. The aim of the study was to determine whether aspirin and clopidogrel are hydrolyzed by the same enzyme(s), thus reciprocally prolonging the antithrombogenic activity. To test this possibility, microsomes from the liver and intestine were assayed for the hydrolysis of aspirin and clopidogrel. In contrary to the hypothesis, aspirin and clopidogrel were hydrolyzed in a tissue-differential manner. Liver microsomes hydrolyzed both drugs, whereas intestinal microsomes hydrolyzed aspirin only. Consistent with the tissue distribution of two carboxylesterases human carboxylesterase (HCE) 1 and HCE2, recombinant HCE1 hydrolyzed clopidogrel, whereas recombinant HCE2 hydrolyzed aspirin. In addition, hydrolysis of clopidogrel among liver samples was correlated well with the level of HCE1, and hydrolysis of aspirin with HCE2. Certain natural variants differed from the wild-type enzymes on the hydrolysis of aspirin or clopidogrel. In the presence of ethyl alcohol, clopidogrel is converted to ethyl clopidogrel. Carboxylesterases are important pharmacological determinants for drugs containing ester linkages and exhibit a large interindividual variation. The isoform-specific hydrolysis of aspirin and clopidogrel suggests that these two antithrombogenic agents may have pharmacokinetic interactions with different sets of ester drugs, and the altered hydrolysis by polymorphic mutants provides a molecular explanation to the interindividual variation.},

  abstract = {Sacubitril was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in combination with valsartan for the treatment of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. As a prodrug, sacubitril must be metabolized (hydrolyzed) to its active metabolite sacubitrilat (LBQ657) to exert its intended therapeutic effects. Thus, understanding the determinants of sacubitril activation will lead to the improvement of sacubitril pharmacotherapy. The objective of this study was to identify the enzyme(s) responsible for the activation of sacubitril, and determine the impact of genetic variation on sacubitril activation. First, an incubation study of sacubitril with human plasma and the S9 fractions of human liver, intestine, and kidney was conducted. Sacubitril was found to be activated by human liver S9 fractions only. Moreover, sacubitril activation was significantly inhibited by the carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) inhibitor bis-(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate in human liver S9. Further incubation studies with recombinant human CES1 and carboxylesterase 2 confirmed that sacubitril is a selective CES1 substrate. The in vitro study of cell lines transfected with wild-type CES1 and the CES1 variant G143E (rs71647871) demonstrated that G143E is a loss-of-function variant for sacubitril activation. Importantly, sacubitril activation was significantly impaired in human livers carrying the G143E variant. In conclusion, sacubitril is selectively activated by CES1 in human liver. The CES1 genetic variant G143E can significantly impair sacubitril activation. Therefore, CES1 genetic variants appear to be an important contributing factor to interindividual variability in sacubitril activation, and have the potential to serve as biomarkers to optimize sacubitril pharmacotherapy.},

In this study, the inhibitory effects of 25 excipients on the activities of CES1A1 and CES2 were evaluated. Imidapril and CPT-11 were used as substrates and cultured with liver microsomes in vitro. Imidapril hydrolase activities of recombinant CES1A1 and human liver microsomes (HLM) were strongly inhibited by sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) and polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated castor oil (RH40) [Inhibition constant (Ki) = 0.04±0.01 μg/ml and 0.20±0.09 μg/ml for CES1A1, and 0.12±0.03 μg/ml and 0.76±0.33 μg/ml, respectively, for HLM]. The enzyme hydrolase activity of recombinant CES2 was substantially inhibited by Tween 20 and polyoxyl 35 castor oil (EL35) (Ki = 0.93±0.36 μg/ml and 4.4±1.24 μg/ml, respectively). Thus, these results demonstrate that surfactants such as SLS, RH40, Tween 20 and EL35 may attenuate the CES activity; such inhibition should be taken into consideration during drug administration.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT
Carboxylesterase (CES) 1 is the most abundant drug-metabolizing enzyme in human livers, comprising approximately 1% of the entire liver proteome. CES1 is responsible for 80%–95% of total hydrolytic activity in the liver and plays a crucial role in the metabolism of a wide range of drugs (especially ester-prodrugs), pesticides, environmental pollutants, and endogenous compounds. Expression and activity of CES1 vary markedly among individuals, which is a major contributing factor to interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of drugs metabolized by CES1. Both genetic and nongenetic factors contribute to CES1 variability. Here, we discuss genetic polymorphisms, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and copy number variants and nongenetic contributors, such as developmental status, genders, and drug-drug interactions, that could influence CES1 functionality and the PK and PD of CES1 substrates. Currently, the loss-of-function SNP G143E (rs71647871) is the only clinically significant CES1 variant identified to date, and alcohol is the only potent CES1 inhibitor that could alter the therapeutic outcomes of CES1 substrate medications. However, G143E and alcohol can only explain a small portion of the interindividual variability in the CES1 function. A better understanding of the regulation of CES1 expression and activity and identification of biomarkers for CES1 function in vivo could lead to the development of a precision pharmacotherapy strategy to improve the efficacy and safety of many CES1 substrate drugs.
Significance Statement
The clinical relevance of CES1 has been well demonstrated in various clinical trials. Genetic and nongenetic regulators can affect CES1 expression and activity, resulting in the alteration of the metabolism and clinical outcome of CES1 substrate drugs, such as methylphenidate and clopidogrel. Predicting the hepatic CES1 function can provide clinical guidance to optimize pharmacotherapy of numerous medications metabolized by CES1.},

Deciphering and understanding the key roles of individual DMEs in drug metabolism and toxicity, as well as characterizing the interactions of central DMEs with xenobiotics require reliable, practical and highly specific tools for sensing the activities of these enzymes in biological systems. In the last few decades, the scientists have developed a variety of optical substrates for sensing human DMEs, parts of them have been successfully used for studying target enzyme(s) in tissue preparations and living systems. Herein, molecular design principals and recent advances in the development and applications of optical substrates for human DMEs have been reviewed systematically. Furthermore, the challenges and future perspectives in this field are also highlighted. The presented information offers a group of practical approaches and imaging tools for sensing DMEs activities in complex biological systems, which strongly facilitates high-throughput screening the modulators of target DMEs and studies on drug/herb‒drug interactions, as well as promotes the fundamental researches for exploring the relevance of DMEs to human diseases and drug treatment outcomes.},

  abstract = {Mammalian carboxylesterases (CEs) are key enzymes from the serine hydrolase superfamily. In the human body, two predominant carboxylesterases (CES1 and CES2) have been identified and extensively studied over the past decade. These two enzymes play crucial roles in the metabolism of a wide variety of endogenous esters, ester-containing drugs and environmental toxicants. The key roles of CES in both human health and xenobiotic metabolism arouse great interest in the discovery of potent CES modulators to regulate endobiotic metabolism or to improve the efficacy of ester drugs. This review covers the structural and catalytic features of CES, tissue distributions, biological functions, genetic polymorphisms, substrate specificities and inhibitor properties of CES1 and CES2, as well as the significance and recent progress on the discovery of CES modulators. The information presented here will help pharmacologists explore the relevance of CES to human diseases or to assign the contribution of certain CES in xenobiotic metabolism. It will also facilitate medicinal chemistry efforts to design prodrugs activated by a given CES isoform, or to develop potent and selective modulators of CES for potential biomedical applications.},

  abstract = {Human carboxylesterase 2 (hCES2) is a glycoprotein involved in the metabolism of drugs and several environmental xenobiotics, whose crystallization has been proved to be a challenging task. This limitation could partly be due to glycosylation heterogeneity and has delayed the disclosure of the 3D structure of hCES2 which would be of upmost relevance for the development of new substrates and inhibitors. The present work evaluated the involvement of glycans in hCES2 activity and thermo stability in an attempt to find alternative active forms of the enzyme that might be adequate for structure elucidation. Partial or non-glycosylated forms of a secreted form of hCES2 have been obtained by three approaches: (i) enzymatic deglycosylation with peptide N-glycosidase F; (ii) incubation with the inhibitor tunicamycin; ii) site directed mutagenesis of each or both N-glycosylation sites. Deglycosylated protein did not show a detectable decrease in enzyme activity. On the other hand, tunicamycin led to decreased levels of secreted hCES2 but the enzyme was still active. In agreement, mutation of each and both N-glycosylation sites led to decreased levels of secreted active hCES2. However, the thermostability of the glycosylation mutants was decreased. The results indicated that glycans are involved, to some extent in protein folding in vivo, however, removal of glycans does not abrogate the activity of secreted hCES2.},
